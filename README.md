This is pretty much a totally unnecessary personal project that will play a sounds whenever a certain ship happens to float by it'll play a sound
Feel free to take the code and do whatever with it. Not like its that good anway lol

Script will only function when there are two mp3 files called intro and outro (So "intro.mp3" and "outro.mp3") in the directory before the python script.
