This is pretty much a totally unnecessary personal project that will play a sounds whenever a certain ship happens to float by it'll play a sound
Feel free to take the code and do whatever with it. Not like its that good anway lol

Script will only play sounds as long as there are two sounds in the /sounds directory (intro|outro.mp3)

alert.py would be the main python script to run.
you need to install the websockets module (pip3 install websockets)
